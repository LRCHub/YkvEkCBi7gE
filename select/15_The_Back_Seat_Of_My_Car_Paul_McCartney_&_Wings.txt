Speed along the highway
Honey, I want it my way
But listen to her daddy's song
"Don't stay out too long"
Ooh, we're just busy hiding
Sitting in the back seat of my car

Looking for a ride in the haul-about
Looking for a ride in and out of town
Stalling around in a haul-about
Looking for a ride in and out of

The lazy lights are pretty
We may end up in Mexico City
But listen to her daddy's song
"Making love is wrong"
Ooh, we're just busy riding
Sitting in the back seat of my car

Aw, we was only hiding
Sitting in the back seat of my car, yeah

And when we finish driving
We can say we were late in arriving
And listen to her daddy's song
We believe that we can't be wrong
Oh, we believe that we can't be wrong
Oh, we believe that we can't be wrong
We can make it to Mexico City
Sitting in the back seat of my car

Oh, we believe that we can't be wrong
Oh, we believe that we can't be wrong
Oh, we believe that we can't be wrong
Oh, we believe that we can't be wrong
Oh, we believe that we can't be wrong
Oh, we believe that we can't be wrong
No, no, no
We believe that we can't be wrong
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh oh, oh oh, yeah, oh, yeah
Yeah
