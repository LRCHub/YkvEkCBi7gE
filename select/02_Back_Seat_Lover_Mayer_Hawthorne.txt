I can't believe what you told me
You know that I'd never hit and tell
You got me right where you want me
With candy apples & sweet caramel
You know I won't say a word
Yeah we can keep it discreet
Darling no one in the world
It's just between you and me
If I gotta be your cheap
Back seat lover
Cruising down the street to nowhere
If I gotta be your cheap
Back seat lover man
Well let's get it on then
Oh I seen you with your girlfriends
Pretending like you never give it away
You look a little nervous
You wanna know if your secret is safe
Baby I won't say a word
Yeah we can keep it discreet
Darling no one in the world
It's just between you and me
If I gotta be your cheap
Back seat lover
Cruising down the street to nowhere
If I gotta be your cheap
Back seat lover man
Well let's get it on then
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Well, let's get it on then
Ooh if you wanted more
I could show you
The possibilities
Oh girl
I just can't ignore
What we could be
But if that's all there is
That's alright with me
If I gotta be your cheap
Back seat lover
Cruising down the street to nowhere
If I gotta be your cheap
Back seat lover man
Well let's get it on
I'll be your cheap
Back seat lover
If that's the way it's gotta be
You know I'll be your cheap
Back seat lover man
Well let's get it on then
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Well let's get it on then
