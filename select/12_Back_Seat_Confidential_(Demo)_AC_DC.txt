Old man's car on a saturday night
Got me a woman me i feel alright
Rockin and rollin at the drive in show
Gonna sit in the back in the passion row

Turn up the soundtrack
Turn down the lights
A chance she won't a chance she might
Ain't no woman in the world i know
Aint had her knickers on the automobile floor
Whats that scoial sound
Somethings going down
Look at what's going around

Back seat confidential

Said to buy my rubber at the cigarette stand
Dying to get it off so i can get it in
Doing my best to make a good connection
She said what you gonna do about my protection
Alright momma gotta listen to me
Last chance thrill its half past three
Huggin and kissin would be real nice
Every man's got his price
Whats that scoial sound
Somethings going down
Look at what's going around

There's a chance she wont but ther's a chance she might

What's that social sound
Somethings going down
Look at what's going around
