Its only 3
Your plane lands at 8
Girl its been so long
I can't hardly wait
Girl it's you I crave
Can't wait to see you baby

I can't work no more
Can't concentrate
When your lips meet mine
I won't hesitate
Girl it's you I want
I've been missing u baby

So by the time I have you close to me
No more livin in a fantasy
I'll be right where I'm supposed to be
Baby we just might be

In the backseat gettin down
In the backseat gettin down
In the backseat gettin down
In the backseat gettin down

Nothing much to do
For the next 3 days
Thank God it's Friday night
And Monday's a holiday
Got my mind on you
I've been Jonesin for you baby

Lets drive up the coast
Lets leave L.A.
Find us a cozy spot
What about Monterey
I can have all of you
All to myself now baby

But by the time I have you close to me
No more livin in a fantasy
I'll be right where I'm supposed to be
Baby we just might be

In the backseat gettin down
In the backseat gettin down
In the backseat gettin down
In the backseat gettin down

Missing u
Wanting u
Needing u
Touching u
Squeezing u
Dreaming u
Teasing u
Pleasing u
Breathing u
Eating u
Sleeping u
Tasting you
Can't wait baby

By the time I have you close to me
No more livin in a fantasy
I'll be right where I'm supposed to be
Baby we just might be

In the backseat gettin down
In the backseat gettin down
In the backseat gettin down
In the backseat gettin down

(Background)
If u believe in love
Lets get down
Lets get down...
