I only overlooked it the last time
The last act never finished
I want to meet you
Those painful 'what if?' dreams
Stir up my heart
A supporting actor's love

I finally realized it now
Do you still
Remember that season?
It shined so brightly it hurt

My lips start moving
As if I'm hypnotized
I want to meet you
A loneliness often found
In these sentimental stories
A supporting actor love

I thought I had completely erased it, but
I'm still in your garden
Tied up
Howling like a dog
I finally realized it now
Do you still
Remember that season?
It shined so brightly it hurt

I'm still
Tied up in your garden
Like a dog
